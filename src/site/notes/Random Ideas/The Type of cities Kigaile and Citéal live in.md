I havenâ€™t seen this landscape done before and I think it could end up really unique and beautiful.

Imagine a futuristic cyberpunk cold Swiss architecture city, mixed with canal transportation and boats like Portugal (rather than Venice).
This would also help bolster their connection to deep sea mining in the colder areas they live in.

I love the idea of smaller powered boats in canals that have to break past thin layers of ice. Or ponds with curved buildings that break off of rivers where blue flowers and solar candles are set to float in the icey water. 

In sketchier parts of town old canals are junky, and glowing strips hang off of once light woven signage.  Bridges are broken with grates and sheeting making up for crumbled sections. Small shops barred up with a few mysterious street vendors and bars along a main river. A long blocked off larger canal that runs through an old long defunct research lab is used for drag (boat) racing.
